<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Your Lab 2 depends on a single master view server to pick the primary.
If the view server is not available (crashes or has network problems),
then your key/value service won't work, even if both primary and
backup are available. It also has the less critical defect that it
copes with a server (primary or backup) that's briefly unavailable
(e.g. due to a lost packet) by either blocking or declaring it dead;
the latter is very expensive because it requires a complete key/value
database transfer.

</p><p>
In this lab you'll fix the above problems by using Paxos to manage the
replication of a key/value store. You won't have anything
corresponding to a master view server. Instead, a set of replicas will
process all client requests in the same order, using Paxos to agree on
the order. Paxos will get the agreement right even if some of the
replicas are unavailable, or have unreliable network connections, or
even if subsets of the replicas are isolated in their own network
partitions. As long as Paxos can assemble a majority of replicas, it
can process client operations. Replicas that were not in the majority
can catch up later by asking Paxos for operations that they missed.

</p><p> Your system will consist of the following players: clients, kvpaxos servers,
and Paxos peers. Clients send Put(), Append(), and Get() RPCs to key/value
servers (called kvpaxos servers). A client can send an RPC to any of the kvpaxos
servers, and should retry by sending to a different server if there's a
failure. Each kvpaxos server contains a replica of the key/value database;
handlers for client Get() and Put()/Append() RPCs; and a Paxos peer. Paxos takes the form
of a library that is included in each kvpaxos server. A kvpaxos server talks to
its local Paxos peer (via method calls). The different Paxos peers talk to each
other via RPC to achieve agreement on each operation.

</p><p>
Your Paxos library's interface supports an indefinite sequence of
agreement "instances". The instances are numbered with sequence numbers. Each
instance is either "decided" or not yet decided. A decided instance
has a value. If an instance is decided, then all the Paxos peers that
are aware that it is decided will agree on the same value for that
instance. The Paxos library interface allows kvpaxos to suggest a
value for an instance, and to find out whether an instance has been
decided and (if so) what that instance's value is.

</p><p>
Your kvpaxos servers will use Paxos to agree on the order in which
client Put()s, Append()s, and Get()s execute. Each time a kvpaxos server receives
a Put()/Append()/Get() RPC, it will use Paxos to cause some Paxos instance's
value to be a description of that operation. That instance's
sequence number determines when the operation executes relative
to other operations. In order to find the value to be returned
by a Get(), kvpaxos should first apply all Put()s and Append()s that are ordered
before the Get() to its key/value database.

</p><p>
You should think of kvpaxos as using Paxos to implement a "log" of
Put/Append/Get operations. That is, each Paxos instance is a log element, and
the order of operations in the log is the order in which all kvpaxos
servers will apply the operations to their key/value databases. Paxos
will ensure that the kvpaxos servers agree on this order.

</p><p>
Only RPC may be used for interaction between clients and servers,
between different servers, and between different clients. For example,
different instances of your server are not allowed to share Go
variables or files.

</p><p>
Your Paxos-based key/value storage system will have some limitations
that would need to be fixed in order for it to be a serious system. It
won't cope with crashes, since it stores neither the key/value
database nor the Paxos state on disk. It requires the set of servers to be
fixed, so one cannot replace old servers. Finally, it is slow: many
Paxos messages are exchanged for each client operation. All of these
problems can be fixed.

</p><p>
You should consult the Paxos lecture notes and the Paxos assigned
reading. For a wider perspective, have a look at Chubby, Paxos Made Live, 
Spanner, Zookeeper, Harp, Viewstamped Replication,
and

</p><h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>

You must write all the code you hand in for 6.824, except for code
that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to
look at anyone else's solution, and you are not allowed to look at
code from previous years. You may discuss the assignments with other
students, but you may not look at or copy each others' code. Please do
not publish your code or make it available to future 6.824 students --
for example, please do not make your code visible on github.

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>
Do a <tt>git pull</tt> to get the latest lab software. We supply you
with new skeleton code and new tests in <tt>src/paxos</tt> and
<tt>src/kvpaxos</tt>.

</p><pre>$ add 6.824
$ cd ~/6.824
$ git pull
...
$ cd src/paxos
$ go test

Ignore the huge number of "has wrong number of ins" and "type Paxos
has no exported methods" errors.

$
</pre>

<p>
Your implementation must support this interface:

</p><pre>  px = paxos.Make(peers []string, me int)
  px.Start(seq int, v interface{}) // start agreement on new instance
  px.Status(seq int) (fate Fate, v interface{}) // get info about an instance
  px.Done(seq int) // ok to forget all instances &lt;= seq
  px.Max() int // highest instance seq known, or -1
  px.Min() int // instances before this have been forgotten
</pre>

<p>
An application calls Make(peers,me) to create a Paxos peer. The peers
argument contains the ports of all the peers (including this one), and
the me argument is the index of this peer in the peers array.
Start(seq,v) asks Paxos to start agreement on instance seq, with
proposed value v; Start() should return immediately, without waiting
for agreement to complete. The application calls Status(seq) to find
out whether the Paxos peer thinks the instance has reached agreement,
and if so what the agreed value is.
Status() should consult the local Paxos peer's state and return
immediately; it should not communicate with other peers.
The application may call Status()
for old instances (but see the discussion of Done() below).

</p><p>
Your implementation should be able to make progress on agreement for
multiple instances at the same time. That is, if application peers
call Start() with different sequence numbers at about the same time,
your implementation should run the Paxos protocol concurrently for all
of them. You should <b>not</b> wait for agreement to complete for
instance i before starting the protocol for instance i+1. Each instance
should have its own separate execution of the Paxos protocol.

</p><p>
A long-running Paxos-based server must forget about 
instances that are no longer needed, and free the memory
storing information about those instances.
An instance is needed if the
application still wants to be able to call Status() for that instance,
or if another Paxos peer may not yet have reached agreement on that
instance. Your Paxos should implement freeing of instances in the
following way. When a particular peer application will no longer need
to call Status() for any instance &lt;= x, it should call Done(x). That
Paxos peer can't yet discard the instances, since some other Paxos
peer might not yet have agreed to the instance. So each Paxos peer
should tell each other peer the highest Done argument supplied by its
local application. Each Paxos peer will then have a Done value
from each other peer. It should find the minimum, and discard all
instances with sequence numbers &lt;= that minimum. The Min() method
returns this minimum sequence number plus one.

</p><p>
It's OK for your Paxos to piggyback the Done value in the agreement
protocol packets; that is, it's OK for peer P1 to only learn P2's 
latest Done value the next time that P2 sends an agreement message to
P1. If Start() is called with a sequence number less than Min(),
the Start() call should be ignored. If Status() is called with a
sequence number less than Min(), Status() should return <tt>Forgotten</tt>.

</p><p>
Here is the Paxos pseudo-code (for a single instance) from the lecture:

</p><pre>
proposer(v):
  while not decided:
    choose n, unique and higher than any n seen so far
    send prepare(n) to all servers including self
    if prepare_ok(n, n_a, v_a) from majority:
      v' = v_a with highest n_a; choose own v otherwise
      send accept(n, v') to all
      if accept_ok(n) from majority:
        send decided(v') to all

acceptor's state:
  n_p (highest prepare seen)
  n_a, v_a (highest accept seen)

acceptor's prepare(n) handler:
  if n &gt; n_p
    n_p = n
    reply prepare_ok(n, n_a, v_a)
  else
    reply prepare_reject

acceptor's accept(n, v) handler:
  if n &gt;= n_p
    n_p = n
    n_a = n
    v_a = v
    reply accept_ok(n)
  else
    reply accept_reject
</pre>

<p>
Here's a reasonable plan of attack:

</p><ol>

<li> Add elements to the <tt>Paxos</tt> struct in <tt>paxos.go</tt>
to hold the state you'll need, according to the lecture pseudo-code.
You'll need to define a struct to hold information about each
agreement instance.

</li><li> Define RPC argument/reply type(s) for Paxos protocol messages,
based on the lecture pseudo-code. The RPCs must include the sequence
number for the agreement instance to which they refer. Remember
the field names in the RPC structures must start with capital letters.

</li><li> Write a proposer function that drives the Paxos protocol for
an instance, and RPC handlers that implement acceptors. Start a
proposer function in its own thread for each instance, as needed
(e.g. in Start()).

</li><li> At this point you should be able to pass the first few tests.

</li><li> Now implement forgetting.

</li></ol>

<p>
Hint: more than one Paxos instance may be executing at a given time,
and they may be Start()ed and/or decided out of order (e.g. seq 10 may
be decided before seq 5).

</p><p>
Hint: in order to pass tests assuming unreliable network, your paxos 
should call the local acceptor through a function call rather than RPC.

</p><p>
Hint: remember that multiple application peers may call Start() on the
same instance, perhaps with different proposed values. An application
may even call Start() for an instance that has already been decided.

</p><p>
Hint: think about how your paxos will forget (discard) information about
old instances before you start writing code. Each Paxos peer will need to
store instance information in some data structure that allows
individual instance records to be deleted (so that the Go garbage
collector can free / re-use the memory).

</p><p>
Hint: you do not need to write code to handle the situation where
a Paxos peer needs to re-start after a crash. If one of your
Paxos peers crashes, it will never be re-started.

</p><p>
Hint: have each Paxos peer start a thread per un-decided instance
whose job is to eventually drive the instance to agreement, by
acting as a proposer.

</p><p>
Hint: a single Paxos peer may be acting simultaneously as acceptor and
proposer for the same instance. Keep these two activities as separate
as possible.

</p><p>
Hint: a proposer needs a way to choose a higher proposal number than
any seen so far. This is a reasonable exception to the rule that
proposer and acceptor should be separate. It may also be useful for the
propose RPC handler to return the highest known proposal number if it
rejects an RPC, to help the caller pick a higher one next time.
The <tt>px.me</tt> value will be different in each Paxos peer,
so you can use <tt>px.me</tt> to help ensure that proposal numbers
are unique.

</p><p>
Hint: figure out the minimum number of messages Paxos should use when
reaching agreement in non-failure cases and make your implementation
use that minimum.

</p><p>
Hint: the tester calls Kill() when it wants your Paxos to shut down;
Kill() sets px.dead. You should call <tt>px.isdead()</tt> in any loops you have
that might run for a while, and break out of the loop if <tt>px.isdead()</tt> is
true. It's particularly important to do this any in any long-running
threads you create.

</p><h3>Part B: Paxos-based Key/Value Server</h3>

Now you'll build kvpaxos, a fault-tolerant key/value storage system.
You'll modify <tt>kvpaxos/client.go</tt>,
<tt>kvpaxos/common.go</tt>, and <tt>kvpaxos/server.go</tt>.

<p>
Your kvpaxos replicas should stay identical; the only exception
is that some replicas may lag others if they are not
reachable. If a replica isn't reachable for a while, but then starts
being reachable, it should eventually catch up (learn about operations
that it missed).

</p><p>
Your kvpaxos client code should try different replicas it knows about
until one responds. A kvpaxos
replica that is part of a majority of replicas that can all reach each
other should be able to serve client requests.

</p><p> Your storage system must provide sequential consistency to applications that
use its client interface. That is, completed application calls to the
Clerk.Get(), Clerk.Put(), and Clerk.Append() methods in
<tt>kvpaxos/client.go</tt> must appear to have affected all replicas in the same
order and have at-most-once semantics.  A Clerk.Get() should see the value
written by the most recent Clerk.Put() or Clerk.Append() (in that order) to the same key.  One
consequence of this is that you must ensure that each application call to
Clerk.Put() or Clerk.Append()
must appear in that order just once (i.e., write the key/value
database just once), even though internally your <tt>client.go</tt> may have to
send RPCs multiple times until it finds a kvpaxos server
replica that replies.

</p><p>
Here's a reasonable plan:

</p><ol>

<li> Fill in the Op struct in server.go with the "value" information
that kvpaxos will use Paxos to agree on, for each client request.
Op field names must start with capital letters. You should use
Op structs as the agreed-on values -- for example, you should pass
Op structs to Paxos Start(). Go's RPC can marshall/unmarshall
Op structs; the call to gob.Register() in StartServer() teaches
it how.

</li><li> Implement the PutAppend() handler in server.go. It should enter a Put
or Append
Op in the Paxos log (i.e., use Paxos to allocate a Paxos instance,
whose value includes the key and value (so that other kvpaxoses know
about the Put() or Append())).
An Append Paxos log entry should contain the Append's arguments,
but not the resulting value, since the result might be large.

</li><li> Implement a Get() handler. It should enter a Get Op in the Paxos
log, and then "interpret" the the log before that point to make sure
its key/value database reflects all recent Put()s.

</li><li> Add code to cope with duplicate client requests, including
situations where the client sends a request to one kvpaxos replica,
times out waiting for a reply, and re-sends the request to a different
replica. The client request should execute just once. Please make sure
that your scheme for duplicate detection frees server memory quickly, for
example by having the client tell the servers which RPCs it has heard a
reply for. It's OK to piggyback this information on the next client
request.

</li></ol>

<p>
Hint: your server should try to assign the next available Paxos
instance (sequence number) to each incoming client RPC. However, some
other kvpaxos replica may also be trying to use that instance for a
different client's operation. So the kvpaxos server has to be prepared
to try different instances.

</p><p>
Hint: your kvpaxos servers should not directly communicate; they
should only interact with each other through the Paxos log.

</p><p>
Hint: as in Lab 2, you will need to uniquely identify client
operations to ensure that they execute just once.
Also as in Lab 2, you can assume that each clerk has only one
outstanding Put, Get, or Append.

</p><p>
Hint: a kvpaxos server should not complete a Get() RPC if it is not
part of a majority (so that it does not serve stale data). This means
that each Get() (as well as each Put() and Append()) must involve Paxos
agreement.

</p><p>
Hint: don't forget to call the Paxos Done() method when a kvpaxos
has processed an instance and will no longer need it or any
previous instance.

</p><p>
Hint: your code will need to wait for Paxos instances to complete
agreement. The only way to do this is to periodically call Status(),
sleeping between calls. How long to sleep? A good plan is to check
quickly at first, and then more slowly:

</p><pre>  to := 10 * time.Millisecond
  for {
    status, _ := kv.px.Status(seq)
    if status == paxos.Decided{
      ...
      return 
    }
    time.Sleep(to)
    if to &lt; 10 * time.Second {
      to *= 2
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>
Hint: if one of your kvpaxos servers falls behind (i.e. did not
participate in the agreement for some instance), it will later need to
find out what (if anything) was agree to. A reasonable way to to this
is to call Start(), which will either discover the previously
agreed-to value, or cause agreement to happen. Think about what value
would be reasonable to pass to Start() in this situation.

</p><p>
Hint: When the test fails, check for gob error (e.g. "rpc: writing
response: gob: type not registered for interface ...") in the log because go
doesn't consider the error fatal, although it is fatal for the lab.
